Pablo Halpern's Experiments
===========================

This repository contains experimental libraries and programs, mostly in C++,
that might be useful to share.  Some of these experiments might lead to
standards proposals, others might be shared as generally useful utilities, and
others will be useless for anybody but me.  For those that I think might have a
wider audience, I will endeavor to keep the following table of contents up to
date and add a README file to the appropriate sub-directories.

The code shared here comes with no warranty of correctness or fitness for any
purpose. Unless otherwise specified, everything is licensed under the Boost
Software License - Version 1.0 (August 17th, 2003), which is available in the
root directory of this repository.
